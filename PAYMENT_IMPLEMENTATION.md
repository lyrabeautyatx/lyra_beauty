# Square Payment Integration Implementation

This document summarizes the complete Square Payment Integration implementation for Lyra Beauty, including down payments, webhooks, and automated payment confirmation.

## üéØ Implementation Overview

The implementation adds comprehensive Square payment functionality to the Lyra Beauty application, enabling:

- **Down Payment Processing**: 20% down payments with automatic invoice generation for remaining balance
- **Full Payment Option**: Traditional full payment processing
- **Webhook Integration**: Automatic payment status updates from Square
- **Refund Processing**: Partial refunds with 20% retention policy
- **Enhanced UI**: Payment type selection and detailed payment tracking

## üîß Core Components

### 1. Square Client Configuration (`/config/square.js`)
- Initializes Square SDK with environment-based configuration
- Provides API instances for payments, invoices, and refunds
- Supports both sandbox and production environments

### 2. Payment Service (`/services/payments.js`)
- **processDownPayment()**: Handles 20% down payments
- **processFullPayment()**: Handles full payments
- **createRemainingPaymentInvoice()**: Generates invoices for balance
- **processRefund()**: Handles partial refunds with retention
- **calculateDownPayment()**: Utility for 20% calculations
- **calculateRemainingPayment()**: Utility for 80% calculations
- **updatePaymentStatus()**: Payment status management

### 3. Webhook Handler (`/routes/webhooks.js`)
- Secure webhook endpoint at `/webhooks/square`
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification
- Handles payment, refund, and invoice events
- Automatic appointment status updates

### 4. Enhanced UI Components
- **Payment Form**: Radio button selection for payment type
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Real-time price updates
- **Payment Confirmation**: Detailed success messages
- **Appointment History**: Payment status and details display

## üí∞ Payment Flow

### Down Payment Flow (20%)
1. User selects "Down Payment" option on payment form
2. Payment form shows 20% amount ($70 for $350 service)
3. Square API processes 20% payment
4. System generates invoice for remaining 80%
5. Appointment saved with "down_payment_completed" status
6. Webhook confirms payment and updates status

### Full Payment Flow (100%)
1. User selects "Full Payment" option on payment form
2. Payment form shows full amount ($350 for $350 service)
3. Square API processes full payment
4. Appointment saved with "full_payment_completed" status
5. Webhook confirms payment and updates status

### Refund Flow
1. Admin initiates refund for appointment
2. System calculates refund amount (keeps 20% down payment)
3. Square API processes partial refund
4. Webhook confirms refund and updates appointment status

## üîí Security Features

### Webhook Signature Verification
```javascript
function verifyWebhookSignature(signature, body, url) {
  const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', webhookSignatureKey);
  hmac.update(url + body);
  const calculatedSignature = hmac.digest('base64');
  return signature === calculatedSignature;
}
```

### Environment Variables
- `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Square API access token
- `SQUARE_APPLICATION_ID`: Square application ID
- `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID`: Square location ID
- `SQUARE_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_KEY`: Webhook signature verification key
- `SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT`: sandbox or production

## üìä Data Structure

### Enhanced Appointment Object
```javascript
{
  id: 1234567890,
  username: "user1",
  date: "2025-09-20",
  time: "10:00",
  service: "microblading",
  serviceInfo: { name: "Microblading", price: 35000 },
  status: "confirmed",
  
  // New payment fields
  paymentType: "down_payment", // or "full_payment"
  paymentStatus: "down_payment_completed", // or "full_payment_completed", "failed", "refunded"
  totalAmount: 35000,
  paidAmount: 7000,
  remainingAmount: 28000,
  
  paymentData: {
    paymentId: "sq0idp-...",
    referenceId: "booking_2025-09-20_10:00_...",
    status: "COMPLETED",
    invoiceId: "inv-...",
    createdAt: "2025-09-20T10:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```
