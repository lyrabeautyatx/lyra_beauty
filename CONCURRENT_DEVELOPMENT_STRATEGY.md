# Concurrent Development Strategy

## üö® **The Problem You Described:**

```
Issue #2: Started from main (commit A) ‚Üí Merges first ‚Üí main is now (commit B)
Issue #3: Started from main (commit A) ‚Üí Tries to merge ‚Üí CONFLICT!
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Prevention Strategies:**

### **1. Daily Sync Strategy (RECOMMENDED)**
```bash
# Every morning, before starting work:
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout your-feature-branch
git merge main
# Resolve any conflicts immediately
git push origin your-feature-branch
```

### **2. Coordinate Issue Completion**
- **Finish simpler issues first** 
- **Break large issues into smaller PRs**
- **Monitor other active issues** in GitHub

### **3. Use GitHub Branch Protection**
Add to your repository settings:
- ‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date before merging
- ‚úÖ Require pull request reviews
- ‚úÖ Automatically delete head branches

## ü§ñ **Copilot Conflict Resolution Process:**

### **When Conflicts Occur:**

1. **Sync your branch with latest main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout issue-3-your-feature
   git merge main
   ```

2. **Ask Copilot for help:**
   - Open conflicted files in VS Code
   - Type: `@workspace Help me resolve these merge conflicts`
   - Copilot will analyze both sides and suggest resolution

3. **Copilot can help with:**
   - **Understanding conflicts**: "What does this conflict mean?"
   - **Choosing sides**: "Which version should I keep?"
   - **Combining changes**: "How can I merge both features?"
   - **Testing resolution**: "What should I test after resolving?"

### **Example Copilot Prompts:**

```
@workspace I have a merge conflict in database/schema.sql. 
Issue #2 added a new table, and my issue #3 also added a table. 
How should I resolve this?
```

```
@workspace Help me understand this merge conflict:
<<<<<<< HEAD
const users = require('./models/users');
=======
const userModel = require('./models/user');
>>>>>>> main
```

## üìã **Best Practices for Your Project:**

### **For Lyra Beauty Specifically:**

1. **Database changes** (Issue #2) should be merged FIRST
2. **Authentication** (Issue #4) should be merged BEFORE booking features  
3. **Payment integration** (Issue #3) can be worked on in parallel
4. **Break large issues** into smaller, independent PRs

### **File-Based Conflict Prevention:**

**High-conflict files to watch:**
- `package.json` - Dependencies
- Database schema files
- Main router files
- Environment configs

**Low-conflict files (safe for parallel work):**
- Individual controllers
- Separate route files  
- CSS/styling files
- Individual view templates

## üîÑ **Recommended Workflow for Multiple Issues:**

### **Day 1:**
```bash
# Issue #2 (Database)
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b issue-2-database-migration

# Issue #3 (Payments) 
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b issue-3-square-integration
```

### **Day 2:**
```bash
# Before starting work on either branch:
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# Sync Issue #2:
git checkout issue-2-database-migration
git merge main

# Sync Issue #3:
git checkout issue-3-square-integration  
git merge main
```

### **When Issue #2 Merges First:**
```bash
# Immediately sync Issue #3:
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout issue-3-square-integration
git merge main
# Resolve any conflicts with Copilot help
git push origin issue-3-square-integration
```

## üéØ **Key Takeaways:**

1. **Sync branches daily** with main
2. **Resolve conflicts early** and often
3. **Use Copilot** for intelligent conflict resolution
4. **Coordinate timing** of issue completion
5. **Break large features** into smaller PRs
6. **Test thoroughly** after resolving conflicts

This strategy will minimize conflicts and make Copilot much more effective at helping when they do occur! üöÄ
